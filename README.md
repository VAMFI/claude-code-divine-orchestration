## üîß Advanced Features

### Agent Auto-Selection
Claude Code automatically suggests the most relevant agent based on your query:

```bash
# These keywords trigger automatic agent selection:
"API development" ‚Üí backend-specialist
"React component" ‚Üí frontend-specialist  
"CI/CD pipeline" ‚Üí devops-engineer
"security review" ‚Üí security-engineer
"test automation" ‚Üí qa-engineer
```
