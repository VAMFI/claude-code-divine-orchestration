# Agents Folder Context

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains 12 specialized AI agent configurations that provide domain-specific capabilities for software development tasks. Each agent represents a different role in the development lifecycle, from backend development to DevOps and project management.

## Key Files & Functions

### Backend & Infrastructure Agents
- `specialists/backend-specialist.md`: API development, database design, server-side architecture (~8k tokens)
- `specialists/devops-engineer.md`: CI/CD pipelines, deployment, infrastructure automation (~8k tokens)
- `specialists/security-engineer.md`: Security architecture, vulnerability assessment, compliance (~8k tokens)

### Frontend & Design Agents  
- `specialists/frontend-specialist.md`: UI/UX implementation, component development, responsive design (~8k tokens)
- `specialists/software-architect.md`: System architecture, design patterns, technical standards (~7k tokens)

### Orchestration & Coordination Agents
- `chief-architect.md`: Master orchestrator for complex, multi-agent projects (~5k tokens)
- `specialists/product-owner.md`: Requirements gathering, user stories, feature prioritization (~7k tokens)
- `specialists/project-manager.md`: Timeline management, resource coordination, stakeholder communication (~9k tokens)
- `specialists/engineering-manager.md`: Team leadership, process optimization, performance management (~6k tokens)
- `specialists/enterprise-cto.md`: Strategic technology leadership, enterprise architecture (~5k tokens)

### Quality & Documentation Agents
- `specialists/qa-engineer.md`: Test strategy, automated testing, quality assurance processes (~8k tokens)
- `specialists/technical-writer.md`: Documentation, API specifications, knowledge management (~9k tokens)
- `specialists/senior-fullstack-developer.md`: Advanced full-stack development, mentoring, integration (~8k tokens)

## Dependencies & Relationships
- **Uses**: All agents read from `../knowledge-core.md` to inform their actions.
- **Used by**: Core agent selection logic in `../core/agent-selection.md`
- **Integrates with**: Context management system for on-demand loading
- **Relates to**: Workflow patterns in `../core/workflow-patterns.md`

## Context Loading Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Agents loaded only when specific technical keywords trigger selection
- **Token Efficiency**: Each agent ~6-9k tokens, loaded individually rather than all at once
- **Smart Selection**: Context-driven selection based on current folder and task requirements

## Agent Selection Triggers
- **Folder-based**: Different agents triggered by working in specific directories
  - `api/`, `services/` → backend-specialist
  - `components/`, `ui/` → frontend-specialist  
  - `deploy/`, `infra/` → devops-engineer
  - `tests/`, `specs/` → qa-engineer

## Usage Patterns
1. **Single Agent Tasks**: Load one specialist for focused work (~8k tokens)
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Use sub-agent delegation for complex projects
3. **Context-Aware Selection**: Agent choice based on current folder context

## Performance Characteristics
- **Individual Load**: 6-9k tokens per agent
- **Selection Accuracy**: >90% with context-driven triggers
- **Memory Efficiency**: Load only needed agents vs traditional "load all" approach
