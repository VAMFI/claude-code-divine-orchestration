# Claude Code Workflow Agents - Project Configuration

This repository contains the official workflow agents for Claude Code CLI, implementing a systematic Research â†’ Plan â†’ Implement methodology.

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Philosophy

Our agents follow a strict three-phase workflow designed to ensure:
- **Accuracy**: All code is based on current, official documentation
- **Safety**: Changes are minimal, reversible, and well-planned
- **Quality**: Every implementation is tested and verified

## ðŸ¤– Available Agents

### 1. docs-researcher
- **Purpose**: Fetches current, version-accurate documentation
- **Trigger keywords**: documentation, API, library, version, migrate
- **Output**: ResearchPack with authoritative sources

### 2. implementation-planner  
- **Purpose**: Creates detailed implementation blueprints
- **Trigger keywords**: plan, design, architecture, strategy
- **Requires**: ResearchPack from docs-researcher
- **Output**: Step-by-step Implementation Plan

### 3. code-implementer
- **Purpose**: Executes precise code changes
- **Trigger keywords**: implement, execute, apply the plan
- **Requires**: Both ResearchPack and Implementation Plan
- **Output**: Working code with test results

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Enforcement

The agents enforce dependencies:
```
docs-researcher â†’ ResearchPack â†’ implementation-planner â†’ Plan â†’ code-implementer â†’ Code
```

- You cannot plan without research
- You cannot implement without a plan
- This prevents coding from potentially outdated memory

## ðŸ’¡ Usage in Claude Code

When you use Claude Code in this project:

```bash
# Automatic workflow
> Add Redis caching to the application
# Claude will sequence: research â†’ plan â†’ implement

# Manual control
> Use docs-researcher to find Redis documentation
> Use implementation-planner to design caching strategy  
> Use code-implementer to add Redis caching

# Skip phases when you have artifacts
> I have the research ready, create a plan
> I have both research and plan, implement it
```

## ðŸ§  Memory Integration

This configuration works with your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` settings:
- Respects the `context7` directive for latest documentation
- Follows the "never code from memory" principle
- Maintains minimal, reversible change philosophy

## ðŸ“š Project Context

When working in this repository:
1. All development follows the three-phase workflow
2. Documentation must come from authoritative sources
3. Plans must include rollback strategies
4. Implementations must be minimal and tested

## ðŸš€ Contributing

When contributing to this project:
1. Enhance agent prompts while maintaining the workflow
2. Add examples that demonstrate the three-phase approach
3. Ensure all changes support the research-first philosophy
