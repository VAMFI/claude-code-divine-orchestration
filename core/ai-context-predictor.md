```

### Context Prediction Models
```python

class ContextPredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sequence_model = LSTMModel(
            input_dim=embedding_size,
            hidden_dim=128,
            output_dim=context_vocab_size
        )
        self.feature_extractor = ContextFeatureExtractor()
        
    def predict_next_contexts(self, current_session):
        """Predict likely context needs based on current session"""
        # Extract features from current development session
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract(current_session)
        
        # Generate sequence embeddings
        sequence_embedding = self.encode_session_sequence(current_session)
        
        # Predict next context probabilities
        context_probs = self.sequence_model.predict(sequence_embedding)
        
        # Filter by relevance threshold and return top candidates
        return self.filter_and_rank(context_probs, current_session)
        
    def train_on_developer_data(self, session_history):
        """Continuously learn from developer behavior"""
        training_sequences = self.prepare_training_data(session_history)
        self.sequence_model.fit(training_sequences)
        self.update_feature_weights(session_history)
```

### Adaptive Learning Framework

3. **Federated Learning**: Learn from team without sharing sensitive code
4. **Multi-Task Learning**: Jointly learn context prediction and optimization
5. **Meta-Learning**: Learn how to quickly adapt to new projects/developers

Model Architecture:

```

## ðŸŽ¯ Predictive Context Loading

### Proactive Context Assembly
```markdown
Prediction-Driven Loading:
1. **Monitor Current Session**: Track folder access, file modifications, git operations
2. **Predict Context Needs**: Use ML models to forecast likely context requirements
3. **Preload High-Probability Contexts**: Load predicted contexts in background
4. **Cache Management**: Optimize cache for predicted vs. actual usage
5. **Continuous Refinement**: Update predictions based on actual developer actions

Prediction Confidence Thresholds:
- >0.8 Confidence: Immediately preload context
- 0.6-0.8 Confidence: Queue for background loading
- 0.4-0.6 Confidence: Monitor for additional signals
- <0.4 Confidence: Do not preload (low probability)
```

### Context Need Prediction Signals
```markdown
Primary Signals:
- Current folder and recent navigation history
- Git branch context and recent commits
- File modification patterns and timing
- Development task type (feature, bug fix, refactor)
- Time of day and session duration

Secondary Signals:
- Code similarity to previous sessions
- Team member collaboration patterns
- Project phase (early development, stabilization, maintenance)
- External dependencies and API changes
- Issue tracker and planning tool context

Signal Fusion Algorithm:
prediction_score = Î£(signal_weight * signal_strength * signal_confidence)
```

### Adaptive Loading Strategies
```markdown
Loading Strategy Selection:
- **Conservative**: High confidence threshold, minimal speculative loading
- **Aggressive**: Lower threshold, maximum predictive loading
- **Balanced**: Optimize for hit rate vs. cache efficiency
- **Personalized**: Adapted to individual developer patterns

Strategy Adaptation Factors:
- Developer experience level (junior vs. senior)
- Project familiarity (new project vs. familiar codebase)
- Task complexity (simple fix vs. major feature)
- Available system resources (memory, processing power)
- Context window utilization patterns
```
