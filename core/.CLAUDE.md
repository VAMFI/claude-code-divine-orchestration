# Core System Context

## Purpose & Responsibility  
Contains the foundational context engineering modules that implement hierarchical memory management, agent selection algorithms, and performance optimization. This is the "brain" of the Context Engineering Platform.

## Key Files & Functions

### Context Management Engine
- `context-management.md`: Core context window optimization system (~15k tokens)
  - Implements memory hierarchy principles (temporal/spatial locality)
  - Proactive context monitoring with 160k/180k token warnings
  - Smart /clear command integration with context preservation
  - Context loading/eviction algorithms using LRU patterns

### Agent Selection Intelligence  
- `agent-selection.md`: Context-driven agent selection logic (~12k tokens)
  - Pattern matching for high-confidence agent selection (90%+)
  - Hierarchical decision trees based on folder context
  - Token usage optimization for single vs multi-agent scenarios
  - Sub-agent delegation rules for complex workflows

### Workflow Coordination
- `workflow-patterns.md`: Multi-agent coordination patterns (~10k tokens)
  - Sequential and parallel workflow architectures
  - Context-efficient emergency response patterns
  - Enterprise-scale project coordination strategies
  - Sub-agent delegation patterns to prevent context overflow

### Performance Analytics
- `performance-monitoring.md`: Context efficiency metrics and optimization (~8k tokens)
  - Context window usage tracking and analysis
  - Agent selection accuracy measurements  
  - Workflow efficiency monitoring
  - Continuous improvement feedback loops

## Dependencies & Relationships
- **Core System**: Loaded by main `../CLAUDE.md` orchestrator
- **Agents Directory**: Provides selection logic for `../agents/` specialists
- **Integrates with**: Project-specific contexts and folder-level .CLAUDE.md files
- **Used by**: All context engineering operations and optimizations

## Context Engineering Algorithms

### Memory Hierarchy Implementation
```
Level 1 (Registers): Current working context       ~800 tokens
Level 2 (L1 Cache): Recently accessed folders     ~2-3k tokens  
Level 3 (Main Memory): Project context            ~3k tokens
Level 4 (Storage): Global system context          ~5k tokens
```

### Smart Loading Patterns
- **Temporal Locality**: Keep recently accessed contexts in working memory
- **Spatial Locality**: Preload related folders based on dependency analysis
- **Prefetching**: Predict likely-needed contexts based on development patterns
- **LRU Eviction**: Remove least recently used contexts when approaching limits

## Performance Characteristics
- **Module Loading**: Individual modules loaded on-demand to minimize context usage
- **Token Efficiency**: Core system ~45k tokens total, loaded selectively
- **Optimization Target**: 85% reduction in context usage vs traditional approaches
- **Response Time**: <2 minutes for context analysis and agent selection

## Usage Patterns

### System Initialization
1. Load main CLAUDE.md orchestrator (5k tokens)
2. Load context-management.md for memory hierarchy setup
3. Load agent-selection.md for intelligent agent routing
4. Additional modules loaded based on task complexity

### Context Engineering Operations
- **Folder Analysis**: Use context-management algorithms to analyze directory structure
- **Agent Selection**: Apply pattern matching and confidence scoring from agent-selection.md
- **Workflow Coordination**: Implement patterns from workflow-patterns.md for complex tasks
- **Performance Monitor**: Track efficiency using performance-monitoring.md metrics

## Integration Points
- **Git Workflows**: Context generation triggered by repository changes
- **Development Tools**: IDE integration for real-time context management
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated context validation and optimization
