# Context Optimization & Performance Monitoring

## üéØ Advanced Context Optimization Algorithms

This module implements sophisticated algorithms for optimizing context window usage, monitoring performance metrics, and continuously improving the Context Engineering Platform's efficiency.

## üß† Context Window Optimization Engine

### Dynamic Context Compression
```markdown
Compression Strategies:
1. **Semantic Compression**: Remove redundant descriptions while preserving meaning
2. **Priority-Based Truncation**: Keep high-priority information, summarize lower priority
3. **Contextual Summarization**: Condense verbose explanations into key insights
4. **Token-Aware Formatting**: Optimize markdown structure for minimal token usage

Compression Algorithm:
- Analyze context relevance to current task
- Calculate information density per token
- Apply lossy compression to least critical sections
- Preserve essential relationships and dependencies
- Maintain minimum viable context threshold
```

### Smart Context Eviction (LRU+)
```markdown
Enhanced LRU Algorithm with Context Engineering:

Eviction Factors:
- Last Access Time (traditional LRU): 40% weight
- Context Relevance Score: 30% weight  
- Dependency Relationship Strength: 20% weight
- Regeneration Cost: 10% weight

Eviction Priority Formula:
eviction_score = (
  time_since_access * 0.4 +
  (1 - relevance_score) * 0.3 +
  (1 - dependency_strength) * 0.2 +
  (1 - regeneration_cost) * 0.1
)

Smart Eviction Rules:
- Never evict current working directory context
- Preserve CORE dependency contexts longer
- Prioritize eviction of WEAK dependency contexts
- Avoid evicting recently generated contexts
```

### Adaptive Context Assembly
```markdown
Context Assembly Optimization:
1. **Task-Specific Assembly**: Select contexts based on current development task
2. **Dependency-Aware Loading**: Load related contexts in optimal order
3. **Token Budget Management**: Maximize information within token constraints
4. **Progressive Loading**: Load essential contexts first, optional contexts as budget allows

Assembly Algorithm:
Input: Current task, available token budget, dependency graph
Output: Optimized context set within budget constraints

1. Load current folder context (highest priority)
2. Calculate dependency scores for related folders  
3. Sort candidates by relevance and dependency strength
4. Greedily select contexts until budget exhausted
5. Apply compression if budget exceeded
6. Cache assembly decision for similar future tasks
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring System

### Real-Time Context Metrics
```markdown
Token Usage Tracking:
- Current context window utilization (real-time)
- Context assembly time and efficiency
- Hit rate for context prefetching
- Memory usage for cached contexts

Performance Indicators:
- Average context assembly time: Target <500ms
- Context relevance accuracy: Target >90%
- Token utilization efficiency: Target >85%
- Cache hit rate: Target >75%
```

### Context Quality Scoring
```markdown
Quality Metrics:
1. **Relevance Score**: How well context matches current task
2. **Completeness Score**: Coverage of essential information
3. **Efficiency Score**: Information density per token
4. **Freshness Score**: How current the context is

Scoring Algorithm:
context_quality = (
  relevance_score * 0.35 +
  completeness_score * 0.25 +
  efficiency_score * 0.25 +
  freshness_score * 0.15
)

Quality Thresholds:
‚úÖ Excellent: 0.85-1.0 (use as-is)
‚ö†Ô∏è Good: 0.70-0.84 (minor optimization)
üîÑ Fair: 0.55-0.69 (needs optimization)
‚ùå Poor: <0.55 (regenerate context)
```

- Track folder access sequences and frequencies
