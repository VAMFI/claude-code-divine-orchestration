# Performance Monitoring & Metrics

## ðŸ“Š Context Window Metrics

### Usage Tracking
```markdown
Monitor and optimize:
- Initial CLAUDE.md load: ~5k tokens (vs original 62k)
- Agent loading cost: ~8k tokens per specialist
- Workflow pattern usage: ~10k tokens when loaded
- Sub-agent delegation frequency
- Context preservation success rate
```

### Performance Targets
```markdown
Context Window Efficiency:
âœ… Initial load <10k tokens (achieved: ~5k)
âœ… Single agent operations <20k tokens  
âœ… Complex workflows <50k tokens (main context)
âœ… Emergency response <30k tokens (coordination)
âœ… Zero context overflow incidents
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Selection Metrics

### Accuracy Measurements
```markdown
Track and improve:
- Agent selection accuracy: >90% target
- User override requests: <10% of selections
- Clarification rounds: <3 per complex request
- Response time: <2 minutes to first action
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 rating
```

### Confidence Score Analysis
```markdown
Confidence Distribution (Target):
- 95%+: 60% of requests (single agent, immediate)
- 85-94%: 25% of requests (single agent + consultation)
- 70-84%: 10% of requests (multi-agent planning)
- <70%: 5% of requests (clarification needed)
```

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Efficiency

### Sub-Agent Delegation Success
```markdown
Measure effectiveness:
- Sub-agent usage frequency
- Context preservation during delegation
- Result quality from sub-agents
- User experience with delegated workflows
- Time savings from parallel processing
```

### Context Management Success
```markdown
Track context optimization:
- /clear usage patterns and timing
- Context preservation accuracy
- Recovery time after /clear
- User satisfaction with context management
- Proactive warning effectiveness
```

## ðŸš¨ Alert System Performance

### Warning System Metrics
```markdown
Monitor alert effectiveness:
- Warning trigger accuracy (160k tokens)
- Critical alert response time (<1 minute)
- User compliance with /clear suggestions
- Context overflow prevention success
- Emergency procedure effectiveness
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement

### Optimization Opportunities
```markdown
Regular review areas:
- Module loading efficiency
- Agent selection pattern accuracy
- Context window usage optimization
- User workflow pattern analysis
- System response time improvements
```

### Feedback Integration
```markdown
Collect and analyze:
- User feedback on agent selections
- Context management satisfaction
- Workflow efficiency ratings  
- Feature request patterns
- Performance pain points
```
