# Usage Examples and Best Practices

This guide provides practical examples of how to effectively use the Claude Code Specialized Agents in real-world development scenarios.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Agents

### Accessing Agents
Once installed, access agents through Claude Code CLI:
```
claude-code
> /agents
```

This displays all available specialized agents with their descriptions and use cases.

### Agent Selection
Claude Code automatically suggests the most relevant agent based on your query, but you can also explicitly request a specific agent:
```
> I need help with database optimization
# Claude automatically suggests backend-specialist

> Use the backend-specialist agent to help optimize my PostgreSQL queries
# Explicitly requests specific agent
```

## ðŸ“š Detailed Usage Scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices for Agent Usage

### 1. Provide Context
Always include relevant context about your project:
- **Technology stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases
- **Team size**: Affects architecture and process recommendations
- **Scale**: User count, data volume, transaction volume
- **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, existing systems

### 2. Be Specific About Problems
Instead of: "Help me with performance"
Use: "My React app with 1000+ item lists is laggy during scrolling and interaction"

### 3. Include Current State
Describe what you've already tried:
- Current architecture or approach
- Previous attempts at solving the problem
- Existing tools and processes in place
- Known constraints or limitations

### 4. Ask for Implementation Details
Request specific, actionable guidance:
- Step-by-step implementation plans
- Code examples and configurations
- Testing and validation approaches
- Monitoring and maintenance strategies

### 5. Follow Up with Questions
Engage in dialogue to refine solutions:
- Ask for clarification on complex concepts
- Request alternatives or trade-offs
- Seek implementation timeline guidance
- Get recommendations for next steps

## ðŸ”„ Multi-Agent Workflows

Some complex scenarios benefit from multiple agents:

### Full-Stack Feature Development
1. **Product Owner**: Define requirements and user stories
2. **Software Architect**: Design system architecture
3. **Frontend Specialist**: Implement UI components
4. **Backend Specialist**: Develop API endpoints
5. **QA Engineer**: Create testing strategy
6. **DevOps Engineer**: Set up deployment pipeline

### Enterprise System Migration
1. **Enterprise CTO**: Strategic planning and decision framework
2. **Software Architect**: Technical architecture design
3. **Project Manager**: Timeline and resource planning
4. **Security Engineer**: Security assessment and implementation
5. **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment strategy

## ðŸ“Š Measuring Success

### Agent Effectiveness Indicators
- **Clarity**: Responses are clear and actionable
- **Completeness**: All aspects of the problem are addressed
- **Practicality**: Solutions are implementable given constraints
- **Quality**: Technical recommendations follow best practices
- **Context**: Responses are appropriate for your team/organization size

### When to Switch Agents
- Current agent responses seem off-topic or inappropriate
- Problem scope expands beyond agent's expertise area
- Need different perspective (strategic vs. tactical)
- Require specialized knowledge in different domain
