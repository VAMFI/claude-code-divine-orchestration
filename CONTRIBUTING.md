- Reporting bugs and inconsistencies

## üìù Agent Structure Guidelines

All agents must follow this consistent structure:

### 1. Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description with examples of when to use this agent
color: agent-color
---
```

### 2. Required Sections
- **Core Identity & Role**: Define responsibilities and scope
- **Philosophy**: Core principles and approach
- **Communication Style**: How the agent interacts
- **Technical Expertise Areas**: Specific technology domains
- **Enterprise Context Adaptation**: Startup, growth, enterprise considerations
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes
- **Technology Stack**: Preferred tools and frameworks
- **Constraints & Guidelines**: Limitations and best practices

### 3. Quality Standards
- **Professional tone**: Enterprise-ready communication
- **Practical examples**: Real-world use cases with context
- **Technical accuracy**: Up-to-date technology references
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Address the full scope of the role
- **Clear boundaries**: Define what the agent does/doesn't handle

## üõ† Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Research and Planning
- Study existing agents for structure and quality
- Research the target role's responsibilities and expertise areas
- Identify key technologies and frameworks for the role
- Plan the agent's unique value proposition

### Step 2: Agent Development
```bash
# Create new agent file
cp agents/backend-specialist.md agents/your-new-agent.md
```

### Step 3: Content Development
1. **Update frontmatter** with appropriate name, description, and color
2. **Define core identity** and role responsibilities
3. **Establish philosophy** and guiding principles
4. **Detail technical expertise** areas with specific technologies
5. **Add enterprise context** for different company sizes
6. **Define success metrics** and measurable outcomes
7. **List technology stack** preferences and recommendations

### Step 4: Testing
```bash
# Install agent locally
cp agents/your-new-agent.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Test with Claude Code
claude-code
# Use /agents command to verify agent appears
# Test agent responses with relevant queries
```

### Step 5: Documentation Updates
- Add agent to README.md agent table
- Update agent count references
- Add usage examples if needed

## üîç Enhancement Guidelines

### Improving Existing Agents
1. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality
2. **Add value incrementally**: Focus on clear improvements
3. **Update technology references**: Keep frameworks and tools current
4. **Enhance examples**: Add more practical, real-world scenarios
5. **Expand expertise areas**: Cover emerging technologies and practices

### Technology Stack Updates
- Research current industry preferences
- Include both established and emerging technologies
- Consider enterprise vs. startup contexts
- Maintain balance between innovation and stability
