## üìù Agent Development Guidelines

### Required Agent Structure

All agents must follow this consistent structure:

#### 1. YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: "Clear description of when to use this agent with specific examples"
color: unique-color
---
```

**Requirements:**
- `name`: kebab-case format, descriptive and unique
- `description`: Specific use cases and triggers for Claude Code's auto-selection
- `color`: Unique color for visual distinction (avoid duplicates)

#### 2. Core Content Sections
1. **Core Identity & Role**: Define responsibilities and scope clearly
2. **Philosophy**: Core principles and approach to problems
3. **Communication Style**: How the agent interacts with developers
4. **Technical Expertise Areas**: Specific technologies and domains
5. **Enterprise Context Adaptation**: Considerations for different org sizes
6. **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and quality indicators

### Quality Standards

#### Professional Excellence
- **Enterprise-ready communication**: Professional, actionable guidance
- **Technical accuracy**: Up-to-date technology references and best practices
- **Practical examples**: Real-world scenarios with concrete implementations
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Address the full scope of the role
- **Clear boundaries**: Define what the agent does and doesn't handle

#### Claude Code Integration
- **Task tool compatibility**: Agents should work effectively with complex workflows
- **Auto-selection support**: Use clear keywords in descriptions
- **Workflow integration**: Consider multi-agent collaboration patterns
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient prompts that work well with Claude Code

## üõ† Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Research and Planning
1. Study existing agents for structure and quality benchmarks
2. Research the target role's responsibilities in modern development
3. Identify key technologies, frameworks, and tools
4. Plan unique value proposition and differentiation
5. Consider integration points with other agents

### Step 2: Agent Development
```bash
# Create new agent file
cp agents/backend-specialist.md agents/your-new-agent.md
```

### Step 3: Content Development
1. **Update YAML frontmatter** with appropriate name, description, and unique color
2. **Define core identity** with specific, actionable responsibilities
3. **Establish philosophy** and guiding principles for decision-making
4. **Detail technical expertise** with current technologies and frameworks
5. **Add enterprise context** for startup, mid-size, and enterprise scenarios
6. **Define success metrics** and measurable outcomes

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
```bash
# Install agent locally
cp agents/your-new-agent.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Test with Claude Code
claude-code

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Agent auto-selection with relevant keywords
# 2. Explicit agent usage with "Use your-new-agent for..."
# 3. Task tool integration for complex workflows
# 4. Multi-agent collaboration scenarios
```

### Step 5: Documentation
- Add agent to README.md agent table with clear use cases
- Update agent count references
- Add usage examples to relevant documentation
- Include workflow patterns if applicable

## üîç Agent Enhancement Guidelines
